TASK 1
The number guessing game is a simple interactive game where the computer selects a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100. The player is then asked to guess what that number is. After each guess, the game checks whether the player's guess matches the number. If it does, the player is congratulated for guessing correctly. If the guess is too low or too high, the game provides feedback accordingly, helping guide the player toward the correct answer. To add a challenge, the number of guesses a player can make is limitedâ€”commonly to five attempts. This means the player must try to find the correct number using logical thinking and clues within a small number of tries. After each round, whether the player wins or loses, they are given the choice to play again. If they choose to continue, a new number is generated and the game restarts. A score is also maintained, increasing each time the player successfully guesses the number. When the player decides to stop, the game ends and their total score is displayed, giving a sense of accomplishment and tracking their performance across rounds.
